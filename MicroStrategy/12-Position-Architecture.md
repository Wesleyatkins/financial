## ðŸ“Š Position Sizing Framework

### Portfolio Allocation Guidelines

#### Conservative Allocation (Risk Level 1-3)
- **Core Position**: 1-2% of total portfolio
- **Maximum Position**: 3% including options
- **Rationale**: High volatility requires limited exposure despite upside potential
- **Suitable For**: Retirement accounts, risk-averse investors

#### Moderate Allocation (Risk Level 4-6)
- **Core Position**: 2-4% of total portfolio
- **Maximum Position**: 5% including options and derivatives
- **Rationale**: Balanced approach capturing upside while limiting downside
- **Suitable For**: Growth-oriented portfolios with diversification

#### Aggressive Allocation (Risk Level 7-10)
- **Core Position**: 3-5% of total portfolio
- **Maximum Position**: 7-10% including leverage products
- **Rationale**: High-conviction play on Bitcoin adoption and MSTR execution
- **Suitable For**: Speculative accounts, high-risk tolerance investors

### Dynamic Position Sizing Model

#### Bitcoin Correlation-Based Sizing
```
Position Size = Base Allocation Ã— (1 + Bitcoin Momentum Factor) Ã— Volatility Adjustment

Where:
- Base Allocation = Risk-adjusted portfolio percentage
- Bitcoin Momentum Factor = (BTC 30-day return - 10%) / 20%
- Volatility Adjustment = 1 - (MSTR 30-day volatility - 40%) / 40%
```

#### Example Calculation (Current Conditions)
- Base Allocation: 3% (moderate risk)
- Bitcoin Momentum: +165% YTD â†’ Factor = 0.775
- MSTR Volatility: ~50% â†’ Adjustment = 0.75
- **Recommended Size**: 3% Ã— 1.775 Ã— 0.75 = **4%**
