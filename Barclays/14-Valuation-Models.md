## Conclusion

Barclays presents compelling value at current levels, trading at significant discounts across multiple valuation frameworks. The [50% DCF discount](https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/banks/lse-barc/barclays-shares) and P/E of 7.8x versus peers at 10.4x create an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity. Our base case 420 GBp target implies 14% upside, while the risk-adjusted probability-weighted target of 413 GBp provides additional conviction.

The key to unlocking value lies in execution of the >12% RoTE target and delivery of £10bn capital returns by 2026. While risks from UK macro, regulatory scrutiny, and ESG concerns persist, the 25% margin of safety and multiple valuation support levels suggest limited downside. For value-oriented investors with 12-24 month horizons, Barclays offers attractive entry at these levels.
