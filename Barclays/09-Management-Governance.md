# üë• BARCLAYS PLC - MANAGEMENT & GOVERNANCE
*Leadership assessment, board composition, and corporate governance analysis*
*September 4, 2025*

---

## Overview

Barclays' leadership underwent significant transition following CEO Jes Staley's forced departure in November 2021 over Epstein ties, with C.S. Venkatakrishnan providing stable succession and strategic clarity. The current management team combines deep institutional knowledge with external expertise, executing a "Simpler, Better, More Balanced" strategy that has delivered 12.3% RoTE in Q2 2025. While the [Upper Tribunal's June 2025 upholding of Staley's ban](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/upper-tribunal-upholds-jes-staley-ban) closes a challenging chapter, governance reforms and enhanced oversight demonstrate commitment to regulatory compliance. Board composition shows strong independence (73%) though diversity improvements remain ongoing.

## Conclusion

Barclays' management and governance have stabilized significantly under Venkatakrishnan's leadership, with clear strategic direction and improving execution. The [successful navigation of the Staley aftermath](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp82lr65y30o) demonstrates institutional resilience, though the [¬£1.1 million fine and prohibition order](https://www.fountaincourt.co.uk/2025/06/landmark-decision-on-integrity-in-financial-services-cases-fcas-decision-to-prohibit-and-fine-the-former-ceo-of-barclays-jes-staley-upheld-by-the-upper-tribunal/) serve as ongoing reminders of governance failures. 

The current leadership team combines appropriate experience with fresh perspectives, executing a transformation agenda that has delivered tangible results. Board composition shows adequate independence though diversity improvements remain a priority. Executive compensation reforms and fair pay initiatives demonstrate stakeholder alignment, while enhanced governance frameworks provide stronger oversight. Overall governance quality rates as SATISFACTORY with improving trajectory, supporting the investment thesis while acknowledging ongoing regulatory and succession risks requiring continued monitoring.
